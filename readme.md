# Blogly

Hosted App: https://joshuatonyy-blogly.cyclic.app/

A full stack project of a markdown blog where you can create, view, edit, and delete articles. In this project, I implemented continuous delivery using Cyclic and Git with MVC architecture. This project also uses MongoDB to store the data. This project is a part of my journey to learn web development.
## My Work:
- Setting up MVC architecture
- Creating CRUD functions for articles
- Creating front end using EJS View Engine, HTML, and Bootstrap 5
- Setting up MongoDB using MongoDB Atlas as Database
- Deploying App to Cyclic

## Tools that I use:
- Node.js that includes library like: Express, EJS Layout, Mongoose, method-override, slugify, dompurify, jsdom
- MongoDB Atlas
- Cyclic
